# Angular Geospatial Data Web Client

This Angular project provides a web client to access and retrieve geospatial data from WMS/WFS/WCS servers. It allows users to send various requests to a server (e.g., GetCapabilities, GetMap) and display the response, including both the XML response document and parsed values. Additionally, it supports displaying multiple layers on top of each other and includes a base layer such as Open Street Maps.

## Functionality

- Send various requests to a server (e.g., GetCapabilities, GetMap, DescribeCoverage).
- Capture and display the XML response document.
- Parse the XML and display only the values.
- Display multiple layers, with the ability to stack them.
- Support a base layer (Open Street Maps).
- Ability to send requests to external WMS/WFS/WCS servers and display the result.
- User interface with capabilities to select layers, SRS, bounding coordinates, format, and size.
